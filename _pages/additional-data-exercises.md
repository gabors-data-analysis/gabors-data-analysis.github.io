### Chapter 07

Does a movie change the importance of characters? Use linear regression to compare screentime vs mentions in a book of your choice. For inspiration: [Lord of the Rings ](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1f8ydnz/lord_of_the_rings_characters_screen_time_vs/) or [Harry Potter](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/kgwl1h/harry_potter_characters_screen_time_vs_mentions/). Maybe even think up reasons why. For extra points, collect data on characters to explain over/under representation.
