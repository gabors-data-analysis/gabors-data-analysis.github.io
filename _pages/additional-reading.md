Life did not stop when we finished the manusdcript. Actually, we keep finding great stuff. So let us make some suggestion for additional readings per chapters. 

## Part I

### Chapter 01

* On **surveys**, a great review is "How to run survey: A guide to creating your own identifying variation and revelealing the invisible", [NBER DP Stefanie Stantcheva](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30527/w30527.pdf).

### Chapter 02

* On the nature of variables, DuckDB has a great post on [Data Types](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/data_types/overview) that for instance details length of numbers.


### Chapter 06

* On *p-hacking*, a fantastic story is about a body of research in social psychology written up in [New York Times Magazine](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html) in 2017. The review of methods started in 2012 soon led to the birth of data investigation team [Data Colada](https://datacolada.org/about) in 2013 by Profs Uri Simonsohn, Leif Nelson and Joe Simmons. They also wrote a [paper on p-curve](http://urisohn.com/sohn_files/wp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pcp2-P-curve-2-published-.pdf), a tool to analyze a body of literature. Read any other pieces of Data Colada on challenges to reproducibility. Amazing stuff. 

* Nice and fun piece on the birthday effect in [pudding](https://pudding.cool/2025/04/birthday-effect/) by Russel Samora. There is a commonly held view that you are more likely to die on your birthday? Is this true? Using millions of Massachusetts residents. Great illustration of step-by-step investigation. 

## Part II

### Chapter 09

* Regarding **external validity**, one way to check robustness is to take out 1% of the data and repeat the exercise. The simple take is to do it many times randonly + many times by edge of distribution of key variables. The smart take is suggested by *Tamara Broderick, Ryan Giordano, Rachael Meager in "An Automatic Finite-Sample Robustness Metric: Can Dropping a Little Data Change Conclusions?"* Hard-core statistics. [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14999)

### Chapter 10

* on the Simpsons paradox, one article where it is front and center is about identifying who migrates published in the [Journal of Development Economics] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387824001081?via%3Dihub): Michael A. Clemens, Mariapia Mendola, Migration from developing countries: Selection, income elasticity, and Simpsonâ€™s paradox, Journal of Development Economics,
Volume 171, 2024


## Part III

### Chapter 16
* On the partial dependence plots, you may check out both a very useful review of [ R's pdp package](https://bgreenwell.github.io/pdp/articles/pdp.html) as well as Christoph Molnar's [Interpretable ML book](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pdp.html).


* On similar house prediction project, Julia Silge does a super nice job hoing through steps, showing graphs. Making great use of text. Boosted trees. Tidymodels and more. Check out her post and video: [Predict housing prices in Austin TX with tidymodels and xgboost](https://juliasilge.com/blog/austin-housing/)

* Why Random Forest work. Useful paper [Alicia Curth, Alan Jeffares, Mihaela van der Schaar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01502)

## Part IV

### Chapter 19
* On **DAGs and Potential outcomes**, deep discussion for social scientists: *Imbens, Guido W. 2020. "Potential Outcome and Directed Acyclic Graph Approaches to Causality: Relevance for Empirical Practice in Economics." Journal of Economic Literature, 58 (4): 1129-79.* [LINK to paper](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191597). An amazing review that includes Twitter quotes. 

## Chapter 19

* Beetroot juice is said to be great. [Review study](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/beetroot-juice-benefits#Overview) [Another review](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324898). For example, reference to an RCT with beetroot juice -- dietary inorganic nitrate acutely reduces blood pressure. [Study](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04675). Review in [medical journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425174/)

## Chapter 20

* On A/B testing, some neat ideas in presentation by [Harlan Harris](https://www.harlan.harris.name/2022/08/communicating-a-b-test-results-for-conversion-rates-with-ratios-and-uncertainty-intervals/?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_403/), with code in R


## Chapter 21

* On the empirics of management, a great review study is [The international empirics of management](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2412205121) by Daniela Scur and her co-authors published in PNAS in 2024.
