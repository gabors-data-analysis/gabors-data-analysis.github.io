<summary><strong>Chapter summary:</strong> This chapter is about data collection and data quality.</summary>
      <p>This chapter starts by introducing <strong>key concepts of data</strong>. It then describes the most important <strong>methods of data collection</strong> used in business, economics, and policy analysis, such as <strong>web scraping</strong>, <strong>using administrative sources</strong>, and <strong>conducting surveys</strong>. We introduce aspects of data quality, such as <strong>validity and reliability of variables</strong> and <strong>coverage of observations</strong>. We discuss how to assess and link data quality to how the data was collected. We devote a section to <strong>Big Data</strong> to understand what it is and how it may differ from more traditional data. This chapter also covers <strong>sampling</strong>, including <strong>random sampling</strong> and potential biases due to <strong>noncoverage</strong> and <strong>nonresponse</strong>, as well as <strong>ethical issues</strong> and some <strong>good practices in data collection</strong>.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Chapter summary:</strong> This chapter is about comparison, correlation, and conditioning.</summary>
      <p>Most methods of data analysis are based on comparing values of one variable, <strong>y</strong>, across observations with different values of another variable, <strong>x</strong>, or more such variables. This chapter instroduces simple methods of such comparison. We start by emphasizing that we need to define both <strong>y</strong> and <strong>x</strong> precisely for meaningful comparisons, and we need to measure them well. We introduce <strong>conditioning</strong>, and we discuss <strong>conditional comparisons</strong>, or further conditioning, which takes values of other variables into account as well. We discuss <strong>conditional probabilities</strong>, <strong>conditional distributions</strong>, and <strong>conditional means</strong>. We introduce the related concepts of <strong>dependence</strong>, <strong>mean-dependence</strong>, and we introduce <strong>covariance</strong> and <strong>correlation</strong>. Throughout the chapter, we discuss informative <strong>visualization</strong> of the various kinds of comparisons.

    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 05: Generalizing from Data</h2>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>Chapter summary:</strong> This chapter is about generalizing from data: sampling, inference, external validity.</summary>
      <p>This chapter introduces the conceptual issues with generalizing results from our data to the general pattern we care about and methods of statistical inference.
We start by discussing the <strong>two steps of the process of generalization</strong>: generalizing from the data to the <strong>general pattern our data represents</strong>, such as a population, and assessing how the <strong>general pattern that is relevant for the situation we care about</strong> relates to the general pattern our data represents. The first task is <strong>statistical inference</strong>, the second is assessing <strong>external validity</strong>. We introduce the conceptual framework of <strong>repeated samples</strong> and <strong>estimation</strong>. We introduce <strong>the standard error</strong> and <strong>the confidence interval</strong> that quantify the uncertainty of this step of generalization. We introduce two methods to estimate the standard error, <strong>the bootstrap</strong> and <strong>the standard error formula</strong>. Discussing external validity, we acknowledge that there are no readily available methods to quantify the uncertainty of this step of generalization, but we discuss how we can think about it and how we may use the results of additional data analysis to assess it.

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Chapter summary:</strong> This chapter is about testing hypotheses.</summary>
      <p>This chapter introduces the logic and practice of testing hypotheses.
We describe the <strong>steps of hypothesis testing</strong> and discuss two alternative ways to carry it out: one with the help of a <strong>test statistic</strong> and a <strong>critical value</strong>, and another one with the help of a <strong>p-value</strong>. We discuss how decision rules are derived from our desire to control the likelihood of making erroneous decisions (<strong>false positives</strong> and <strong>false negatives</strong>), and how <strong>significance levels</strong>, <strong>power</strong>, and <strong>p-values</strong> are related to the likelihood of those errors.  We focus on testing hypotheses about averages, but, as we show in one of our case studies, this focus is less restrictive than it may appear. The chapter covers <strong>one-sided versus two-sided alternatives</strong>, issues with <strong>testing multiple hypotheses</strong>, the perils of <strong>p-hacking</strong>, and some issues with testing on Big Data.

      <summary><strong>Chapter summary:</strong> This chapter is about simple regression.</summary>
      <p>In this chapter, we introduce <strong>simple non-parametric regression</strong> and <strong>simple linear regression</strong>.
We discuss nonparametric regressions such as <strong>bin scatters</strong>, <strong>step functions</strong> and <strong>lowess</strong> regressions and their visualization. The larger part of the chapter discusses simple linear regression in detail. We introduce the <strong>regression equation</strong>, how its coefficients are <strong>estimated</strong> in actual data by the method of <strong>ordinary least squares (OLS)</strong>, and we emphasize how to <strong>interpret the coefficients</strong>. We introduce the concepts of <strong>predicted value</strong>, <strong>residual</strong>, and <strong>goodness of fit</strong>, and we discuss the relationship between regression and correlation. We end with a note on the relationship between causation and regression.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Chapter summary:</strong> This chapter is about generalizing results of a regression.</summary>
      <p>This chapter discusses the methods of generalizing results of a linear regression from our data to the general pattern we care about.
We start by describing the two steps of generalization in the context of regression analysis: <strong>statistical inference</strong> and <strong>external validity</strong>. Then we turn to statistical inference: quantifying uncertainty brought about by generalizing to the general pattern represented by our data. We discuss how to <strong>estimate the standard errors and confidence intervals</strong> of the estimates of the regression coefficients, how to <strong>estimate prediction intervals</strong>, and how to <strong>test hypotheses about regression coefficients</strong>. We introduce <strong>ways to visualize</strong> the confidence interval and the prediction interval together with the regression line, and we introduce the standard way to <strong>present the results of regression analysis</strong> in tables.</p>

      <summary><strong>Chapter summary:</strong> This chapter is about multiple linear regression.</summary>
      <p>This chapter introduces <strong>multiple regression</strong>.
We start by discussing why and when we should estimate a multiple regression and how to interpret its coefficients. We then turn to how to construct and interpret <strong>confidence intervals of regression coefficients</strong> and <strong>test hypotheses about regression coefficients</strong>. We discuss the relationship between multiple regression and simple regression and derive the <strong>omitted variable bias</strong>. We explain that piecewise linear splines and polynomial regressions are technically multiple linear regressions without the same interpretation of the coefficients. We discuss how to include <strong>categorical explanatory variables</strong> as well as <strong>interactions</strong> that help uncover different slopes for groups. We include an informal discussion on how to decide what explanatory variables to include and in what functional form. Finally, we discuss why a typical multiple regression with cross-sectional observational data is not a <strong>ceteris paribus</strong> comparison, and that, as a result, it may get us closer to causal interpretation without fully uncovering it.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Chapter summary:</strong> This chapter is about modeling probabilities.</summary>
      <p>This chapter introduces probability models that have a <strong>binary dependent variable</strong>.
It starts with the <strong>linear probability model</strong>, and we discuss the interpretation of its coefficients. Linear probability models are usually fine to uncover average associations, but they may be less good for prediction. The chapter introduces the two commonly used alternative models, <strong>the logit</strong> and <strong>the probit</strong>. Their coefficients are hard to interpret; we introduce <strong>marginal differences</strong> that are transformations of the coefficients and have interpretations similar to the coefficients of linear regressions. We argue that linear probability, logit, and probit models often produce very similar results in terms of the associations with explanatory variables, but they may lead to different predictions. We discuss and compare various measures of fit for probability models, such as the <strong>Brier-score</strong>, and we introduce the concept of <strong>calibration</strong>. We end by explaining how data analysts can analyze more complicated *y* variables, such as <strong>ordinal qualitative variables</strong> or <strong>duration variables</strong>, by turning them into binary ones and estimating probability models.</p>

      <summary><strong>Chapter summary:</strong> This chapter is about regression with time series data.</summary>
      <p>In this chapter we discuss the opportunities and challenges brought about by regression analysis of time series data and how to address those challenges.
The chapter starts by discussing features of time series variables, such as <strong>trends</strong>, <strong>seasonality</strong>, <strong>random walk</strong>, and <strong>serial correlation</strong>. We explain why those features make regression analysis challenging and what we can do about them. In particular, we discuss when it’s a good idea to transform the *y* and *x* variables into differences, or relative differences. We introduce two methods to get appropriate standard error estimates in time series regressions: <strong>the Newey–West standard error estimator</strong> and including the <strong>lagged *y* variable</strong> on the right-hand side. We also discuss how we can estimate delayed associations by adding <strong>lags of *x*</strong> to a time series regression, and how we can directly estimate <strong>cumulative, or long run, associations</strong> in such a regression.</p>
