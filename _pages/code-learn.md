Here is some tip and advice on how to learn coding.

# Big picture

A well respected resource that introduces thinking about coding for data analysis is [Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner’s Guide](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf){:target="_blank"} by Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse M. Shapiro. They talk about issues like replication, organization of a project, or version control. 

# Learning to code for data analysis

## R
There are two popular *toungues* (beyond base) in R, called *data.table* and *tidyverse*. We use *tidyverse*.  
There are great many resources, to learn R for data analysis. Here are some ideas:   

1. To learn tidyverse, you may start with the wonderful book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/){:target="_blank"}.  
2. A wonderful intro, with a focus on starting R and data wrangling, is by Jenny Briant's [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](https://stat545.com/){:target="_blank"} course, aka STAT545.   
3. U Cincinatti has a very nice guide with discussions on basics, workflow, manipulation in [R Programming Guide](https://uc-r.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.   
4. At CMU, Alexandra Chouldechova has a nice [programming in R materials](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/achoulde/94842/){:target="_blank"}.  
5. A great online course is by Roger Peng, Jeff Leek and Brian Caffo  [R programming onCoursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
6. At Data Carpentry, François Michonneau and Auriel Fournier has a fantastic content --[Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/){:target="_blank"}.  
7. Grant McDermott has a more advanced lecture series with amazing content [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures){:target="_blank"}.   
8. Working with **time series** is hard. A great resource by Hansjörg Neth: Data Science for Psychologists [Chapter 10 Dates and times](https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/10-time.html){:target="_blank"}.   
9. What They Forgot to Teach You About R, awesome material by Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester. [workshop material](https://rstats.wtf/){:target="_blank"}.   
10. Great style guide with suggestions on coding by Sean Higgins. [R guide](https://github.com/skhiggins/R_guide){:target="_blank"}.   
11. Nice, dplyr focused intro into called *An introductory workshop on modern data analyses and workflows* by folks at Aarhus, available as [Reproducible Research in R](https://r-cubed.rostools.org/index.html)
12. A list of useful stuff: [Hacks](https://towardsdatascience.com/ten-time-saving-r-hacks-b411add26b96), 


## Stata
There are many great materials, here is some we like:   
1. UCLA extensive material at [UCLA IDRE Stats](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/modules/){:target="_blank"}. 
2. Amazing two part series by Kurt Schmidheiny [Part 1](https://www.schmidheiny.name/teaching/stataguide.pdf){:target="_blank"} 
[Part 2](https://www.schmidheiny.name/teaching/stataguide2up.pdf){:target="_blank"}  
3. At Data Carpentry, CEU's Miklós Koren and Arieda Muco are developing a [Stata course for Economist](https://datacarpentry.org/stata-economics/){:target="_blank"}.  
4. A Stata [cheatsheat](https://geocenter.github.io/StataTraining/portfolio/01_resource/){:target="_blank"}.
5. One of the greatest, coolest somewhat advanced Stata resource is the Medium site of Asjad Naqvi [The Stata Guide](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide){:target="_blank"} that includes pearls like [Stata and Github integration](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide/stata-and-github-integration-8c87ddf9784a){:target="_blank"} 


## Python
Python is a general purpose language, used for many applications beyond data science/statistics. There are great many resources, to learn Python for data analysis. Here are some ideas:   
1. Very nice courses are available widely, for instance on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science){:target="_blank"}, and [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python){:target="_blank"}.
1. A set of very nice lessons at [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/){:target="_blank"}.
1. NYU has a great group also offering a Python cours by [QuanEcon](https://quantecon.org/lectures/){:target="_blank"}.
1. Great style guide with suggestions on coding by Sean Higgins. [Python guide](https://github.com/skhiggins/Python_guide){:target="_blank"}.


# Learning a second language
Some people have experience using one language but would now learn a second one. Some ideas we found useful:


## R for Stata users
In Economics and many other social sciences, we use Stata for research, and learnt R or Python as a second language. Here are some links and tutorials we found useful.  
1. Matthieu Gomez has a wonderful intro to [ R for Stata users ](https://www.matthieugomez.com/statar/index.html){:target="_blank"}. For instance the bit on [regressions](https://www.matthieugomez.com/statar/regressions.html){:target="_blank"} is pretty useful, I come back to it regularly.   
2. John Ricco has a short intro to [basics of data wrangling](https://johnricco.github.io/2016/06/14/stata-dplyr/){:target="_blank"}  


## R to/from Python
For this textbook, Stata and R code were developed early on, and we started to work on Python code set only after the proof was ready. Some ideas we (and our RAs) found useful
1. [GGplot for Python by Monash ](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/python-workshop-base/modules/plotting_with_ggplot/){:target="_blank"}    
2. [Pandas and tidyverse](https://www.carloscamara.es/en/blog/2020/02/08/manipulating-dataframes-in-r-and-python/){:target="_blank"}     


## Python for Stata users

1. Adam Ross Nelson (2020) [Going From Stata to Pandas](https://towardsdatascience.com/going-from-stata-to-pandas-706888525acf) -- a longer post on Medium



## Tools
Great list of data tools by the UC Berkeley Library and Research IT run [Research Data Management (RDM) Program](https://researchdata.berkeley.edu/tools)
