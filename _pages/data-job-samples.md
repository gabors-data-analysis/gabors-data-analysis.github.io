REQ-017278
The mission of The New York Times is to seek the truth and help people understand the world. That means independent journalism is at the heart of all we do as a company. It’s why we have a world-renowned newsroom that sends journalists to report on the ground from nearly 160 countries. It’s why we focus deeply on how our readers will experience our journalism, from print to audio to a world-class digital and app destination. And it’s why our business strategy centers on making journalism so good that it’s worth paying for. 

 

### Job Description


The Data Journalism department seeks three experienced reporters with programming skills to contribute data-driven coverage on a variety of topics, often collaborating with colleagues across the newsroom. 

As a data reporter, you’ll combine traditional reporting with data analysis to publish stories on a variety of deadlines. You have excellent data analysis skills, with the news judgment to match, and can design rigorous methodologies, bulletproofing your analyses and handling thorny data issues. 

Collaboration is at the heart of this role; you’ll work with reporters and editors on desks across the newsroom. You are eager to help others level-up their own skills — both in data literacy and data analysis — and excited about learning from others. 

This is a hybrid position that includes regular attendance at one of our offices or bureaus. New York is preferred, followed by DC. Then, San Francisco, Los Angeles or Chicago.

### Responsibilities:

Pitch and report data-driven stories that illuminate the day’s news events, explain difficult concepts and investigate wrongdoing

Obtain and build datasets through FOIA, web scraping, document parsing and shoe-leather approaches 

Develop an understanding of these datasets, enabling you to mine them for reporting leads, meaningful insights, and newsworthy findings.

Be comfortable working on stories both independently and in diverse teams

Demonstrate support and understanding of our value of journalistic independence and a strong commitment to our mission to seek the truth and help people understand the world

You will report to the Data Editor 

### Basic Qualifications:

3+ years of relevant experience

Experience finding, requesting, cleaning and analyzing complex datasets 

Ability to communicate data findings powerfully, accurately, and succinctly

Proficiency working with data in Python and/or R

Advanced spreadsheet and database skills (e.g., joins, pivot tables, etc.)

### Preferred Qualifications:

Experience with, and a preference for, working collaboratively on multidisciplinary teams

Subject-specific knowledge of the datasets available on at least one beat (e.g.,  healthcare, business, demographics, or criminal justice)

Traditional reporting skills

Experience reporting in response to major news cycles

Comfort with command-line tooling, version control, and other important technical skills

### Compensation
The annual base pay salary for this role is between $111,049.64 and $140,000.00.


### More
Please submit a cover letter that highlights three stories published on a variety of deadlines (e..g, breaking news, medium feature, deep investigation). For each story, please provide a link and describe your contribution in one or two paragraphs. In your cover letter, you are also welcome to provide a more traditional (but brief) description of your career and talents.
