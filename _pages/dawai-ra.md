## Overview

### Key info
* Project title: Prediction with Machine Learning for Economists
* Name(s) of supervisor(s): Gábor Békés
CEU Department: Department of Economics and Business
* Location: Vienna / online
* Approximate workload (hour/week): 8-10
* Total gross remuneration in EUR 1300-1800 (could be 2x if working for 6 months)
* Application deadline: Aug 15, 2024
* Start date: 21 August, 2024 (or later)
* End date: 15 December, 2024

### The project detal
We develop a new course material, “Data Analysis with AI“ to equip students already versed in core methods of data analysis on how best to harness generative AI (GenAI) technologies to improve their productivity. We will focus on large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or Claude. 

The material is based on the my textbook Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy (with Gábor Kézdi, Cambridge University Press, 2021.) will be composed of 6-8 class packages, each focusing on a use case of data analysis method or task. It will teach how applying genAI can enhance one's analytical work in domains such as creating a survey, analyzing an unknown dataset, producing a descriptive report, or carrying out modelling with machine learning – all with using AI. The material will help develop debugging skills that are essential to benefit from the technology, and ideally help overcome student aversion.

## Specific tasks
1. 	Do a review of efforts on how instructors and students use AI for data analysis, 
2. 	Scale up testing of prompts in different ways and platforms, and 
3.  Develop new case studies, test them, help decide on the material. Case studies include descriptive (data wrangling, simulation), prediction (machine learning) and causal inference (staggered difference in differences, synthetic control).

## Background
We are looking for two graduate students with shorter assignment or one student with longer one. 

They may be 2nd year MA or 2nd or 3rd year Phd in Economics or other quantitative social science programs. 

### Expected experience
* Good knowledge of econometrics and introductory familiarity with data science 
* Good knowledge of R or Python 
* Experience with the following tools: Git/Github, Latex/markdown

### Advantages
* Experience with Quarto, Latex Beamer, Reveal.js 
* Experience / Knowledge of my textbook 
* Some experience with two language out of R, Python, Stata
