> “This exciting new text covers everything today's aspiring data scientist needs to know, managing to be comprehensive as well as accessible. **Like a good confidence interval, the Gabors have got you almost completely covered!**”

> “This is an excellent book for students learning the art of modern data analytics. This book combines the latest techniques with practical applications, replicating the implementation side of classroom teaching that is typically missing in textbooks. For example, they used the World Management Survey data to generate exercises on firm performance for students to gain experience in handling real data, with all its quirks, problems and issues. **For students looking to learn data analysis from one textbook this is a great way to proceed.**”

> “I know of few books about data analysis and visualization that are as comprehensive, deep, practical, and current as this one; and I know of almost none that are as fun to read. **Gábor Békés and Gábor Kézdi have created a most unusual and most compelling beast: a textbook that teaches you the subject matter well and that, at the same time, you can enjoy reading cover-to-cover.**”

> “**A multifaceted book that considers many sides of data analysis, all of them important for the contemporary student and practitioner.** It brings together classical statistics, regression, and causal inference, sending the message that awareness of all three aspects is important for success in this field. Many ‘best practices’ are discussed in accessible language and illustrated using interesting datasets.”

> “Energy and climate change is a major public policy challenge, where high-quality data analysis is the foundation of solid policy. This textbook will make an important contribution to this with its innovative approach. **In addition to the comprehensive treatment of modern econometric techniques, the book also covers the less glamorous but crucial aspects of procuring and cleaning data, and drawing useful inferences from less-than-perfect datasets.** An important and practical combination for both academic and policy professionals.”
