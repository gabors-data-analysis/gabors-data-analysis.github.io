**Current projects related to the Data Analysis textbook and ecosystem**

## Case study development 

We believe students learn best through real-world case studies. Our collection of 42 case studies (with more in development) primarily teach data analysis and econometrics methods along with the necessary coding and data science tools. They also explore substantive topics like wage inequality, market dynamics, and policy interventions, with global coverage spanning diverse economic contexts.

We develop the case studies that power the Data Analysis ecosystem: Idea development, background reviews, domain knowledge + Data collection + Code writing and testing (Python, R, Stata) +  Reports, case study documents, slides

## Course and study material development

### Data Analysis with AI

New course, still in development: [Data Analysis with AI](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/ai-course/). From getting to code with AI to reporting, text analysis and supporting causal inference. 


## Teaching support

### Dashboards

We are developing a series of education interactive tools. 

These [dashboards](https://dashboards.gabors-data-analysis.com/) illustrate what happens when we measurement error of different sorts, helps compare regressions in a no code environment or explain causal links.
