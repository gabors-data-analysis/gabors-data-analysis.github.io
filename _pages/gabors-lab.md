## About

**Gabors Data Analysis and AI Lab** is a research and education initiative housed within the Economics Department of Central European University. The lab brings together economists, quantitative social scientists, and data science professionals united by a core mission:  making data analysis and data science education and research capabilities widely accessible. The lab serves as a bridge between academia and business, and between research and teaching. We create high-quality and innovative teaching materials for data analysis and econometrics and support data sciene and AI intensive research projects in economics and social sciences. 

## What we do

Our work centers on developing comprehensive educational resources tied to the Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy textbook ecosystem. We create and maintain open-source code repositories, setup documentation, case studies, and practice materials, alongside instructor dashboards (dashboards.gabors-data-analysis.com) that support teaching worldwide. We launched an innovative [Data Analysis with AI](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/ai-course/) course reflecting our commitment to integrating artificial intelligence into quantitative education and research support. All our materials are free and open-source. We train the next generation of applied data analysts: our research assistants and associates launch careers as data scientists in business, pursue PhDs, or conduct policy research.
