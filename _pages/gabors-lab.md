## About

**Gabors Data Analysis and AI Lab** is a research and education initiative housed within the Economics Department of Central European University. The lab brings together economists, quantitative social scientists, and data science professionals. 

Our mission is "Creating innovative open-source educational resources and supporting research in data analysis, data science, and AI for economics and social sciences." 

The lab serves as a bridge between academia and business, and between research and teaching. We create high-quality and innovative teaching materials for data analysis and econometrics and support data sciene and AI intensive research projects in economics and social sciences. 

The lab was founded by Gábor Békés ([CEU, Austria; KRTK, Hungary and CEPR, UK](https://www.gaborbekes.com)) and [Gábor Kézdi](https://kezdigabor.life/) (formerly: Corvinus, CEU, KRTK and U Michigan, USA) 


## What we do

Our work centers on developing comprehensive educational resources tied to the Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy textbook ecosystem. We create and maintain open-source code repositories, setup documentation, case studies, and practice materials, alongside instructor dashboards (dashboards.gabors-data-analysis.com) that support teaching worldwide. We launched an innovative [Data Analysis with AI](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/ai-course/) course reflecting our commitment to integrating artificial intelligence into quantitative education and research support. All our materials are free and open-source. We train the next generation of applied data analysts: our research assistants and associates launch careers as data scientists in business, pursue PhDs, or conduct policy research.
