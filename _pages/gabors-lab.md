## About

Gabors Data Analysis and AI Lab is a research and education initiative housed within the Economics Department of Central European University, operating across our Vienna and Budapest campuses. The lab brings together economists, quantitative social scientists, and data science professionals united by a core mission: democratizing data science education and research. We focus on creating high-quality teaching materials for data analysis and econometrics, supporting AI-intensive research in economics and social sciences, and training the next generation of applied data analysts for both academic research and business applications.

## What we do

Our work centers on developing comprehensive educational resources tied to the Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy textbook ecosystem. We create and maintain open-source code repositories, setup documentation, case studies, and practice materials, alongside instructor dashboards (dashboards.gabors-data-analysis.com) that support teaching worldwide. The lab co-organizes an annual Data Analytics event at CEU and has launched an innovative [Data Analysis with AI](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/ai-course/) course reflecting our commitment to integrating artificial intelligence into quantitative education and research support. All our materials are free and open-source. Our research assistants and associates launch careers as data scientists in business, pursue PhDs, or conduct policy research.
