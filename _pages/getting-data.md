You can download dataset folders from [OSF.io](https://osf.io/7epdj/)

## There are several options. 


### Download a folder
You can download a dataset folder, such as [hotels-europe](https://osf.io/r6uqb/), by clicking on the OSF storage button, and then choosing download. This will download the clean and raw folder in a single zip.


### Download a file
You can download any files by simply clicking on them. Text file may be directly opened and looked at.

### Download all the clean datasets

You can download a single ZIP file that contains all datasets, with clean datasets only. This is for size considerations (the raw data are 20GB or so). 

To get it just visit the [da_data_repo](https://osf.io/3u5em/) site of our OSF repo, download, unzip and enjoy. 


### Copy the whole osf.io project
You can [fork](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019737914-Fork-a-Project) this whole repo to your own and make changes as you wish, keeping license regulations. 

This may be used for instructors, who may use our datasets to create a smaller, more compact version for their course.
