I would like to wholeheartedly praise this book. I am totally impressed by its depth, clarity and applications of the book. The exercises are highly applied and coming from industry-relevant questions which will be of highly interests for economics, business, or even data science students. The Online Resources are great with clear and detailed codes and instructions in R, Stata, and Python, which provide a rich range of approaches for students. I will highly recommend this book for my students if they would like to develop the tools and understandings of econometrics and data science techniques. I would like to thanks Bekes and Kezdi for their excellent book. It’s one of the best textbook in econometrics and data science that I’ve ever read.

I have reviewed the book, and I think it is excellent. I plan on using it as a supplemental book for my Business Strategy and Analytics module here at UCL School of Management. I find it to be quite exhaustive and very well organized. It is very consistent with how I organize my module. I think they covered nearly everything that I would want covered in a book like this.

“The structure of the book is revolutionary with respect to existing textbooks, both in terms of coverage and approach. In Part I (Data Exploration), rather than emphasising/pivoting around formal statistical procedures or properties of data generation processes, the authors focus on conceptual presentation and case studies, and yet, the intuitive concepts are rigorously framed. In Part II (Regression Analysis), I found Chapter 8 ('Complicated Patterns and Messy Data') particularly important to bridge the abstract, ideal configuration of regression analysis with practitioners' problems emerging when facing actual data. Parts III and IV introduce frameworks allowing to predict (Part III) or explain (Part IV) a target variable. These latter parts evince epistemological depth in the authors' conception of applied statistics, as well as an unrivalled, up-to-date organisation of topics, according to emerging trends in data science. Technical details are kept in "Under the hood" sections, allowing students to delve into more formal aspects of the topics presented. Finally, the distinction between 'Practice Questions' and 'Data Exercises' allows instructors to fine-tune practical sessions according to a differential emphasis on conceptual vis-a-vis hands-on aspects of module delivery.”
