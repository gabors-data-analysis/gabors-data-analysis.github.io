The Lab serves as a bridge between academia and business.

### What we'll do together

Together with our partners, we aim to:

* Develop joint case studies for teaching data analysis and data science.  
* Create educational content beyond case studies—user guides, podcasts, interactive apps, and more.  
* Produce open-source, reproducible research materials and guides for the social sciences.  
* Collaborate on events (such as the CEU Data Analytics Jamboree) and on education-related projects.  

### What partners gain

Partners will:

* Join our mission of creating innovative, open-source educational resources and supporting research in data analysis, data science, and AI for economics and social sciences.  
* Benefit from visibility as contributors to global, open-access knowledge.  
* Connect with a vibrant community, gain early access to emerging talent, and showcase collaboration in marketing materials.  
* Build networks with leading academics, data professionals, and like-minded organizations.  

### In practice, partners will:

1. Provide data for case studies.  
2. Support development by covering staff costs—or by offering staff time (e.g. a one-day-per-week secondment to the Lab).  
3. Contribute PR and marketing support to promote materials.  
4. Dedicate senior staff time to brainstorming use cases, educational materials, and outreach.  
5. Help cover technology and related costs.
