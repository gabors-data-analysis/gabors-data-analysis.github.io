# Doing analysis with data

1. Know thy data. Origin stories matter. 
2. Garbage data + simple stats = garbage. Garbage data + AI = convincing garbage . 
3. Data does not speak. The analyst speaks via data and analysis. 

## Methods

1. RCT with N=32 << observation study w N== 100k << RCT with 1K. 
2. RCT is often not doable for ethical or practical reasosns. 
3. Observational analysis is hard but good data and 100+ years of statistics and econometrics can get you close to a causal interpretation


## On acquiring knowledge we can act on

1. Our enemies (after sugary drinks) are  p-hacking, publication bias, outright cheating driven by researchers and industry interests. 
2. Despite best intentions we do not know many things, ok to change view in light if new evidence.
