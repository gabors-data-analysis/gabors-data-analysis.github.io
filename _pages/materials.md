## Errors and issues and comments
As more and more people are reading the book, errors emerge. We started to collect them at an [Errata page](/errata)
If you find one please [let us know](/contact-us)

With such a large code-base, there may be many errors, or sipmly better ways to do stuff. If you have a suggestion, please open an issue at our [github repo](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies/issues)

All comments are much appreciated!


## How to to teach it?

## Slides

As we have been teaching a course based on the book (or actually, wrote a book based on the course...), we will instructors to see and even use our slides. There will be 24 slideshows, one for each chapter. In a graduate program, a slideshow would run for about 100-150 minutes. In an undergraduate program, it can be taken at a slower rate.   

After a simple registration, you can download   
* Download [PDFs] of slides
* Download all images used in the slideshow in a zip file. (Or just run the scripts for any case study. (Images in the book were made in R.) 

This will open in late April 2021.
