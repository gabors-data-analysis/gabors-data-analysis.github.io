## How to to teach it?
This course may be used for a variety of courses, and it is needed used Management Phd, Applied Economics MA, Data Science MSc or even in Executive MBA. 

We offer some experience and advice on [how to teach this textbook for different courses](/teaching-guide/). A more extended version will be made available for instructors at the Cambridge University Press website. 

Also we have some questions and answers for a variety of course and program types on the [Instructor FAQ](/instructor-faq/)

We started to get some feedback from colleagues piloting the book, see on [Instructors' feedback](/instructor-feedback)

You can see a [list of programs](/courses-using/) that are using this textbook.


## Solutions to practice questions

We have written a 100 page document offering suggested answers to the practice 360 questions in the book.   
This will be made available after registration with Cambridge University Press.   
Coming soon, around late April 2021

## Slides

As we have been teaching a course based on the book (or actually, wrote a book based on the course...), we will instructors to see and even use our slides. There will be 24 slideshows, one for each chapter. In a graduate program, a slideshow would run for about 100-150 minutes. In an undergraduate program, it can be taken at a slower rate.   

After a simple registration, you can download   
* Download [PDFs] of slides
* Download all images used in the slideshow in a zip file. (Or just run the scripts for any case study. (Images in the book were made in R.) 

This will open in late April 2021.

## Additional reading suggestions
We started to add a few additional [reading suggestions](/additional-reading). 


## Questions and answers
The book was piloted in several Universities and programs in 2020, and online teaching allowed collecting student questions. We started to collect and post them. 
* [Part I - Chapter 01-06](/part1-qanda)
* [Part II - Chapter 07-12](/part2-qanda)
* [Part III - Chapter 13-18](/part3-qanda) - this already has content
* [Part IV - Chapter 19-24](/part4-qanda)




## Errors and issues and comments
As more and more people are reading the book, errors emerge. We started to collect them at an [Errata page](/errata)
If you find one please [let us know](/contact-us)

With such a large code-base, there may be many errors, or sipmly better ways to do stuff. If you have a suggestion, please open an issue at our [github repo](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies/issues)

All comments are much appreciated!
