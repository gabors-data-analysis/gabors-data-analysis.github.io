## Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy
This textbook provides future data analysts with the **tools, methods, and skills** needed to answer data-focused, real life questions, to choose and apply appropriate methods to answer those questions, and to visualize and interpret results to support better decisions in business, economics, and public policy. Data wrangling and exploration, regression analysis, prediction with machine learning, and causal analysis are comprehensively covered, as well as when, why, and how the methods work, and how they relate to each other. **More info**: [Front Matter](https://assets.cambridge.org/97811084/83018/frontmatter/9781108483018_frontmatter.pdf), [Content](https://assets.cambridge.org/97811084/83018/toc/9781108483018_toc.pdf), [PDF of sample chapters](https://www.book2look.com/vbook.aspx?id=9781108483018)   

A cornerstone of this textbook are **47 case studies** spreading over one-third of our material because working through case studies is the best way to learn data analysis. Each of our case studies starts with a relevant question and answers it in the end, using real life data and applying the tools and methods covered in the particular chapter.  Our case studies cover a wide range of topics: *consumer decision, economic and social policy, finance, business and management, health, and sport*. Their regional coverage is also wider than usual: one third is from the U.S.A., one third is from Europe and the U.K., and one third is from other countries or includes all countries from Australia to Thailand. **More on content**: [chapter summaries](/chapters/), [case study summaries](/casestudies/)

## Endorsements

* “This exciting new text covers everything today's aspiring data scientist needs to know, managing to be comprehensive as well as accessible.  Like a good confidence interval, the Gabors have got you almost completely covered!”  **Joshua Angrist (MIT)**
* "A beautiful integration of Econometrics and Data Science that provides a direct path from data collection and exploratory analysis to conventional regression modeling, then on to prediction and causal modeling. Exactly what is needed to equip the next generation of students with the tools and insights from the two fields." **David Card (University of California, Berkeley)** 
* “This book combines the latest techniques with practical applications, replicating the implementation side of classroom teaching that is typically missing in textbooks.” **Nicholas Bloom (Stanford)**
* “This sophisticatedly simple book is ideal for undergraduate or Master’s level Data Analytics courses with a broad audience.” 
**Carter Hill (Louisiana)**
* “Strong data skills are critical for modern business and economic research, and this text provides a thorough and practical guide to acquiring them.”   **John Van Reenen (MIT Sloan/LSE)**
* “I know of few books about data analysis and visualization that are as comprehensive, deep, practical, and current as this one; and I know of almost none that are as fun to read.”  **Alberto Cairo (Miami)**
