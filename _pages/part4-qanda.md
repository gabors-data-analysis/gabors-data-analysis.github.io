## Chapter 23

>**Q: In a panel regression, when we are taking the differences of log values on either side, am I thinking right that we are supposed to report percentage point changes instead of percentage changes??**    

A: No, it is actually percent changes. Log difference is an approximation of relative difference in percent. We shall use percentage points when the x or y variable is already in percent, such as share of immunization for children (Ch23, case study B). Then, we did *not* take logs, but kept percent, so difference between percent values is the percentage point.
