## Chapter 19

>**Q: Do we ever observe the ATE? Or are we just trying to estimate ATE?**

A: We never observe individual treatment effects, and ATE is their average. When we have random assignment or, close to partialling out endogenous variation in x, we have a chance to estimate ATE. But in the data itself, we never observe it. 


## Chapter 23

>**Q: In a panel regression, when we are taking the differences of log values on either side, am I thinking right that we are supposed to report percentage point changes instead of percentage changes?**    

A: No, it is actually percent changes. Log difference is an approximation of relative difference in percent. We shall use percentage points when the x or y variable is already in percent, such as share of immunization for children (Ch23, case study B). Then, we did *not* take logs, but kept percent, so difference between percent values is the percentage point.
