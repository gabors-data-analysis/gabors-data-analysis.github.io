### Graduate program, into metrics (regression)

Often graduate economics, political science or business analytics programs start with a first-semester class focusing on regression analysis. Could be called Data Analysis, Introduction to Econometrics, or Quantitative Methods. 

[Part II](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/chapters/#part-ii-regression-analysis) of the textbook will serve this course well. Depending on time and background you might want to 
* add bits from Chapters 05 and 06, maybe as refresher. 
* skip Chapter 12 on time series. 
* add bits from Chapter 19 on thinking about causality with observational data. 


As a graduate course, it will assume students have some background in statistics. What if this may not be assumed?
* Give them chapters 01-04 of [Part 1](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/chapters/#part-i-data-exploration) as reading with a focus on the nature of data and data types (Ch 02), frequency, probability, distributions (Ch03), and most of Chapter 04. Maybe offer consultations for students in need. 
* Cover Ch05 and Ch06, possibly fast. Generalization and basic hypothesis testing are necessary for Part 2. 
* You may skip bootstrap (ch05) and final bits of testing (ch06)
