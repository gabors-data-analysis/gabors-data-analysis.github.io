## Error correction

The most important plan will be correcting typos and errors based on the errata. 
* typos, errors
* improve unclear sentences 
* add a few lines of explanation when needed

## Minor changes

* Add coeffplots (Chapter 10, Chapter 21)
* Show tables with p-values and stars, add a para discussion ref back to p-hacking + both have pros and cons (Ch 10, Ch 22)
* Add run time in google colabs / amazon cloud for Table 16.4 (Chapter 16)


## New things

We plan only up to half a dozen new things, typically a few extra pages. 

Some ideas are

* Add a page on Frisch-Waughn-Lowell theorem (no proof), with a case study application. The key application will be a graph, ie show show scatterplot despite controls. Maybe use earnings. Or even add a new case study on Mankiw-Romer-Weil QJE growth regressions. [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/@carlos-mendez/R-Augmented-Solow-Model-d90f7550-909c-407d-8295-9ba49e81764f) (This may be Chapter 10, or maybe somewhere else)

* For the machine learning bit, add SHAP in addition to VIP (Chapter 16)

* Event study, maybe add one of new DiD method using the same case study. (chapter 24)
