## Data Analysis is a Process: Doing real life empirical projects 

**The Seven Steps of Data Analyis**  lecture discusses the process of empirical projects: research question, data collection, cleaning and wrangling, exploration, modeling, communicating results, and answering our question and discussing the validity. It also touches upon a range of issues related to working with data: aspects of collection and data wrangling with an emphasis on the role of coding, data engineering and reproducible research.  The lecture is based on Békés-Kézdi: Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy (Cambridge UP 2021) 

The talk is 60-90 mins. 

### Target audience
The target audience is terminal year undergraduate  (BA, BSc) as well as applied Masters (MA/MSc) students in economics, finance, business and other social sciences who intend to a dissertation (thesis) with an emprical focus. 


### Topics

In particular, to discuss data analysis as a process, we'll discuss 7 topics about how data analysis will...

1. First comes a research topic and a specific research question
2. Data collection is the foundation for all empirical work
3. Cleaning and organizing the data is a necessary and time-consuming part
4. Exploratory data analysis helps both data preparation and analysis
5. Analytical work tests hypotheses and estimates model(s)
6. Results shall be presented in a user friendly way
7. Finally, we answer the original question and discuss generality

### A case study
Throughout the talk I will use a case study from my textbook on family ownership of firms and management quality. The case study is based on the [World Management Survey](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/casestudies/#ch21a-founderfamily-ownership-and-quality-of-management), data from [WMS](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/wms-management-survey/)
