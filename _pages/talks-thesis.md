## Data Analysis is a Process: Doing real life empirical projects 

In the lecture I will discuss how real-life analytical projects are different to many academic examples that students have typically seen. 
The lecture is based on Békés-Kézdi: Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy (Cambridge UP 2021) 

The talk is 60-90 mins. 


### Topics
The talk is centered around three topics.  First, I focus on the starting phase of a project: data collection and data wrangling and possible difficulties associated with the process. I will discuss the role of coding, data engineering and reproducible research. Second, I will talk about the research question and answer, how the analytical process moves from a broad question, into a testable model and the choice of methods to apply. In particular, I will talk about causal thinking and how far we may go with observational data. Third, I will discuss what to do with results we got, how to generalize from the data, think about external validity and answer the research question we started with. 

### A case study
Throughout the talk I will use a case study from my textbook on family ownership of firms and management quality. 

Data and code in Stata, R and Python are available for anyone interested to learn more. 

### Tools
 I'll talk about 7 tools as well: 
 * presentation and thesis in Latex/Overleaf 
 * Survey collection with SurveyMonkey and alike 
 * Coding environments Rstudio and ProjectJupyter
 * Graphics and ggplot2 /plotnine, 
 * Reproducible research with git and github
 * Presenting results with markdown 
 * Communication with Twitter


### Target audience
The target audience is terminal year undergraduate  (BA, BSc) as well as applied Masters (MA/MSc) students in economics, finance, business and other social sciences who intend to a dissertation (thesis) with an emprical focus.
