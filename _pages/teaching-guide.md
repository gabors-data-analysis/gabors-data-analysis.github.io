## The book allows for individual learning, facilitating flexible teaching

The textook is suitable for individual learning as well as traditional classroom teaching, online teaching, or any hybrid version. It aims to include everything students would neet for individual learning, including intuitive explanations, practical advise, practice questions, and the opportunity to work with code. All of this helps instructors, too, to design their courses in flexible ways. In particular, they can assign entire chapters, or parts of chapters, as individual reading, and spending precious contact time on what they find most important or interesting. Moreover, they can use the additional resources to assign homeworks or adminster quizzes to check whether students acquired the necessary knowledge and skills.


## Instructors can use the entire book or just parts of it

The book is designed to teach a year-long course in data analysis. 
An academic year is approximately 30 weeks long, and the book has four parts with 24 chapters in total. Most chapters can be covered within a week, leaving time for review and to go over time with some of the chatpers.
Which parts to teach when is straightforward for programs structured in in semesters. In programs that divide the 30 weeks into 3 parts (trimesters or quarters) it's a bit more complicated but there are several options. One is to teach two of the four parts together in one term, e.g., parts I and II in term one. This can be done by allocating more time per week and/or assigning some chapters as individual reading.

Alternatively, instructors can use only parts of the book to augment their current teaching.

One option is to take some of our case studies without adopting the textbook. Reading and assigning the textbook makes sense even in that case. 1/3 of the book is about the case studies, with intriductions, data descriptions, explanations, and the results themselves. Even if you opt to use our case studies only, PLEASE GIVE US DUE CREDIT, citing us on your slides and handouts.

Other options include re-desiging only some of courses with the textbook, or introducing new courses with bsed on the textbook.  


## Designed for graduate programs, first part suitable for undergraduate programs

The maths and stats prerequisits allow for undergraduate teaching. In particular, students don't need prior knowledge of any statistical theory. They don't need programming experience, either, because they would learn coding during the course using the statistickal of their choice (Stata, R, Python). The case studies cover a wide range of fields that can cater to the diverse interests of an undergraduate group. For these resonts the book is adequate for both graduate and undergraduate courses.

At the same time, this textbook is long, and learning the material requires a lot of individual work from the students. According to our experience, students spend at least twice as much time on individual work than on contact hours. (With three hours -- 2x90 mins -- of lecture and one hour -- 1x60 mins -- of practice session for contact time, this workload can add up to 4+8=12 hours per week.) Most undergraduate programs can't require that much work from their students. 

Thus, the best way to use our book in undergraduate teaching is to cover parts I and II in one academic year, and maybe offer parts III and IV in a later year.


## Applied approach that may also be used in academic programs

Our approach is applied, in the sense that studnts should be able to acquire a working knowledge of the entire process of data analysis with the most important methods. In particular, they should be able to carry out real-life data analysis without taking more courses. It is thus well suited for masters' level programs, such as MBA, MA Economics (non-PhD track), MSc in Business Economics/Management, MA in Public Policy, MSc in Finance, MA in Health Policy, MA in Quantitative Social Sciences, or Business Analytics programs. It can be used in undergraduate programs with a focus in business, economics, finance, quantitative social studies, or policy. Moreover, it is well suited for academic programs that are less focused on formal statistical and econometric theory, such as Ph.D. in Management or Ph.D. in Public policy.

In addition, we think that academic programs with a formal statistics / econometrics / data science focus can also use our textbook in their more applied data analysis courses.

 Most such programs start with formal courses in statistical and econometric theory and move on to applied data analysis in their 2nd year. But they could do that in a reverse order, instead, starting with applied, and moving on to more formal and advanced topics later. Our textbook is suitable for such teaching. It doesn't build on previous formal knowledge, but it explains the whys and hows in detail. Indeed, starting with our textbook be a better option in many programs. According to our experience, students appreciate if their first data analysis courses equip them with meaningful skills and working knowledge wo that they can start whinking about, and working on, actual projects. Applied courses tend to increase students' motivation to learn more, taking more advanced and more formal statistics, econometrics, and predictive analysis / machine learning courses.


## A few tips

Quizzes. Instructors can administer a quick quiz at the beginning of each lecture, using practice questions from the most recently covered material. This tends to make students review the material before class and use the practice questions to check their knowledge. It also serves as an attendance check and makes sure students arrive on time.

Assign reading in advance. The textbook is suited for individual learning. Instructors can make active use of that feature and assign readings to students. Indeed, they can assign the entire chapter in advance, use simple quizzes in the beginning of class to make sure students study the material, and focus the precious contact time on questions, emphasizing a few things, and, most imporantly, case studies.

Run code in class. Instructors can reproduce the results by running code, in front of the class or together with students, in both online and offline settings. According to our experience, students appreciate seeing the sausage in the making, and it empowers them to do the same on their own. In a traditional setting with lectures and practice sessions, the practice sessions instructors should always run code in class, but they can do that to complement lectures, too. 

Make students replicate results. Each chapter ends with five data expercises, some of which are simple variations on the main case study. Students should start with the case study code shared with them andmodify them to get the new results. According to our experience, students like replicating the results they have seen and doing simple modifications, because this helps them with coding as well as understanding the concenptual aspects of data analysis.


## Example sequences

We list a few examples of how our textbook can be used in particular programs. These examples assume using our textbook for all, or most, of the material that the courses want to cover. If, instead, instructors want to use parts of our textbook, such us our case studies, they can do that in any way they like in statistics / econometrics / data analysis courses in any program.

### A single core data course in graduate business/management programs
