### Option A (easy)
Use AI as your assistant to find real-world data that matches or closely resembles the one used in the FT graph, and recreate the same chart using that data.

**what to submit**
* Graph: A PDF version of your recreated graph, name it: "lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftfigure.pdf"
* Data: A CSV file with the data used to create the graph, with the name ("lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftdata.pdf")

Use AI as your assistant to build an interactive app (dashboard) that mimics the FT graph. 
* Minimum requirement: the you shall be able to set dates, and hover around values
* Ideal: get the app update data and graph dynamically.
 * could be upload new data
 * best: automatic via API

**what to submit**
* link to app
  * you can use tools like steamlit (Python), shinyapps (R), etc
