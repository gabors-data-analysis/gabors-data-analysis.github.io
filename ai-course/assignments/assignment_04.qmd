Create groups of 2-3 people who use the same coding language.

### Task
Ask AI to give you a list of research questions that can be answered using many (at least 4) of the hotel data sets provided. Iterate with AI to find an interesting question using a persona.
* Write code that joins the required data

**Option A (easy)**
* Write code to do the analysis (conditional comparison / some simple regression)
* Produce a single figure that shows the answer (or a simple version of the answer) to the research question (e.g. scatterplot and regression line, or boxplot, etc)
Create a min. 6 - max. 10 pages slide show to illustrate the research question, the merging process, the figure and the conclusion.

For example, you can use the following slide show structure, each bit is 1-2 slides:
* Research question and why/for whom you picked it
* Data and variables
* Detailed steps of joining tables to get to the work data (here be specific, include schema, keys used, join types, 2-4 slides)
* Steps of creating your variables for analysis
* Result and interpretation
  
**Option B (advanced)**
* **In addition to the tasks in Option A**, choose another real-world dataset that could be merged with the hotel data.
* Choose an additional question that can be answered using the hotel data and the newly merged dataset.
* Add two slides where you 1) describe how you joined the two datasets and 2) include a figure that shows your finding
