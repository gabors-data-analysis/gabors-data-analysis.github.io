This folder contains cleaned and processed data from the 7th Wave of the World Values Survey, merged with World Bank GDP indicators. The WVS is a global research project that explores people's values and beliefs across different countries and cultures.

**Used in:** Week 2 (Data Documentation), Week 3 (Report Writing)

## Files

### Processed Data
- **`WVS_random_subset2000.csv`** - Random subset of 2,000 respondents stratified by country
- **`WVS_GDP_merged_data.csv`** - Country-level aggregated data merged with GDP and population indicators
- **`WVS_subset.csv`** - Selected variables from full dataset (all respondents, waves 1-7)

### Documentation
- **`codebook.pdf`** - Official WVS codebook with variable definitions and survey methodology
- **`README_WVS.md`** - Data processing documentation and variable descriptions

### Code
- **`cleaning.R`** - R script that processes raw WVS data and creates the cleaned datasets

## Data Structure

### WVS_random_subset2000.csv
- **Observations:** ~2,000 individual respondents
- **Variables:** Demographics (country, interview date, weights) + survey items (Q1-Q89, Q260-Q290)
- **Purpose:** Manageable sample for exploration and practice

- Random sampling uses seed `20250124` for reproducibility
- GDP data covers 2017-2023 to match survey timing variations
- See `README_WVS.md` for detailed processing steps
