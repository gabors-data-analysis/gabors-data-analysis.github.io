title: "Austrian Hotels Dataset"
---

## Overview

This dataset contains realistic simulated data on hotels across Austria, designed for practicing data wrangling and table joins. The dataset consists of multiple related tables that can be combined using various join operations.

**Used in:** Week 4 (Joining Tables)

**Generated by:** Claude AI (Sonnet 3.7) with realistic relationships between variables

## Dataset Structure

The dataset includes 8 related tables with hotels across Austrian cities, covering occupancy, pricing, tourism statistics, and economic indicators.

### Core Tables

| File | Description | Rows | Key Columns |
|------|-------------|------|-------------|
| `hotels.csv` | Basic hotel information | 200 | `hotel_id` (PK) |
| `cities.csv` | City information | 10 | `city` (PK) |
| `monthly_occupancy.csv` | Monthly hotel performance metrics | ~3,800 | `hotel_id`, `month`, `year` |
| `city_tourism.csv` | Monthly tourism statistics by city | 240 | `city`, `month`, `year` |
| `economic_indicators.csv` | Monthly economic indicators | 24 | `month`, `year` |
| `reviews.csv` | Hotel guest reviews | ~1,700 | `review_id` (PK), `hotel_id` (FK) |
| `amenities.csv` | List of possible hotel amenities | 10 | `amenity_id` (PK) |
| `hotel_amenities.csv` | Hotel-amenity relationships | ~1,000 | `hotel_id`, `amenity_id` |

## Key Relationships

- **One-to-One:** Hotels ↔ Cities (through city name)
- **One-to-Many:** Hotels → Monthly Occupancy, Hotels → Reviews
- **Many-to-Many:** Hotels ↔ Amenities (through `hotel_amenities`)
- **Composite Keys:** Monthly data requires `(hotel_id, month, year)` or `(city, month, year)`

## Documentation

- **`hotel-data-readme.md`** - Detailed schema documentation with column descriptions and data types

## Learning Objectives

This dataset allows students to practice:
- Inner, left, right, and full joins
- One-to-one and one-to-many relationships
- Composite key joins
- Data aggregation after joins
- Handling missing values in joins

## Sample Research Questions

- How do hotel prices vary by city and season?
- What's the relationship between amenities and guest ratings?
- How do economic indicators affect hotel occupancy rates?
- Which cities have the highest tourism-to-hotel capacity ratios?
