## Overview

Code examples for sentiment analysis of football manager interviews, supporting both R and Python workflows.

**Related to:** Week 5-6 (Text as Data)

## API Setup

### `api-key.R`
Template for setting up OpenAI API credentials in R.
```r
# Set your API key
Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-....")
```
**Important:** Copy to `my-openai-api-key.R` and add to `.gitignore`

## R Scripts

### `sentiment-analysis.R`
Complete sentiment analysis workflow using OpenAI API.

**Features:**
- API key setup and validation
- Batch processing with progress tracking
- Sentiment classification function (-2 to +2 scale)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Comparison between multiple API runs

**Key functions:**
- `classify_text()`: Sends text to OpenAI for sentiment rating
- Handles API errors with exponential backoff
- Saves results to CSV for further analysis

### `domain_lexicon.r`
Creates football-specific sentiment lexicon.

**Output:** `domain_lexicon.csv` with:
- 100+ football-specific terms
- Positive terms (goals, win, excellent): scores 1.2-1.9
- Negative terms (lose, poor, mistake): scores -1.9 to -1.2
- Neutral terms (match, team, play): score 0

## Python Scripts

### `classify_manager_sentiment.py`
Python equivalent of R sentiment analysis.

**Features:**
- OpenAI API integration using `openai` library
- Logging and progress tracking with `tqdm`
- Robust error handling
- Same rating guidelines as R version

**Dependencies:**
```python
pip install openai pandas tqdm python-dotenv
```

### `manager_sentiment_api.md`
Documentation and code template for Python API usage.

## Usage Notes

### API Key Management
- Store keys in environment variables
- Never commit keys to version control
- Budget ~$5 for course exercises

### Rate Limiting
- Both scripts include retry logic
- Exponential backoff for failed requests
- Monitor usage through OpenAI dashboard

### Reproducibility
- Set `temperature=0` for consistent results
- Save intermediate results
- Document model versions used

## Output Files

Scripts generate:
- `manager_sentiment_results.csv`: Individual text ratings
- `sentiment_comparison.csv`: Comparison between runs
- `classification.log`: Detailed processing logs

## Integration with Course Data

These scripts work with:
- `/data/interviews/interview-texts-only.xlsx` (input)
- `/data/interviews/domain_lexicon.csv` (lexicon)
- Student rating files for comparison analysis
