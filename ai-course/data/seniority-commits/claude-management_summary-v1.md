# Employee Commit Pattern Analysis: Management Summary
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Dataset:** 600 employees across IT (n=376) and Analytics (n=224) divisions

---

## Key Findings

### 1. **The Productivity Paradox**
- **Tenure correlates with total commits** (r=0.53 Analytics, r=0.42 IT)
- **BUT: Commits per year DECLINE with tenure**
  - Junior: ~200 commits/year
  - Mid-level: ~350 commits/year  
  - Senior: ~175 commits/year *(despite 10x tenure)*

### 2. **Significant Engagement Issues**
- **31 employees (5%) have zero commits**
  - 23 with >1 year tenure
  - Concentrated in Analytics (8) and IT (23)
- These are visible in the chart as **orange X marks**

### 3. **Department Differences**
- **IT outperforms Analytics** in raw commits (1,054 vs 823 avg)
- But productivity patterns similar across both
- Mid-level employees show strongest productivity in both

### 4. **Elite Performers are Rare**
- Only **2 employees (0.3%)** exceed 2,000 commits/year
- Both are mid-level (1 Data Engineer, 1 Developer)
- Marked as **red circles** in visualization

## Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Interview the 23 zero-commit veterans** - understand blockers
2. **Study the 2 high performers** - identify best practices
3. **Review senior role expectations** - why is productivity declining?

**Strategic Priorities:**
1. **Retention risk**: Mid-level (1-5 years) employees are most productive but may leave for senior roles elsewhere
2. **Onboarding gaps**: Junior employees show low activity; likely need better support
3. **Senior underutilization**: Experienced staff may be in too many meetings or management activities

**Note:** Analysis assumes commits = productivity proxy. May need to consider: code review, mentoring, architecture decisions not captured in commit counts.
