1,12,04/12/2024,04/12/2024,10,"I've said many times already to the other media there were moments in the game where you thought if we could come away from here with a draw it would be a good result, but those moments were mainly in the first half. In the second half, especially after we scored for 1-1, I thought we were really impressive. We created so many opportunities, good chances. Then [the result] feels like a disappointment.
I think PLAYER had a massive impact on the game as well. PLAYER came in really well, PLAYER also, but I think in general in the second half we played much, much better than the first half. In the first half we had a lot of problems with their intensity, aggressive playing style without the ball – aggressive in a good way. We tried to cope with it, but every time we touched them we got a yellow and that doesn't really help for us to be intense then as well. But we give credit to them, they were more intense than us. They forced us into too many mistakes. It wasn't that difficult for us to be better in the second half with the ball and that's what we were. Maybe it was difficult for them to keep the intensity of the first 45 minutes going and as a result of that, or of all of these things, we dominated the second half.
It is difficult for me to predict the long-term future, the only thing I can expect or predict is PLAYER is in a very good place at the moment. PLAYER plays in a very good team that provides him with good opportunities and then he is able to do special things. What makes PLAYER even more special for me is before we scored for 1-1 you thought, ' PLAYER is not playing his best game today,' but then to come up with a half-hour with an assist, two goals, having a shot against the bar and being a constant threat, that is something not many players can do if they've played the first hour like PLAYER did. So, that is also what makes PLAYER special, apart from if you just look at the goals. PLAYER’s finishing is so clinical. A special player, but that's what we all know.
I have seen many games of last season but it is always difficult to judge a player if you are not there. What I did most was [look at] style of play and team performance and not that much the individual performance and what I noticed from the start, when PLAYER came in [in pre-season was] how fit PLAYER was, how ready PLAYER was to make it a very good season. That PLAYER led by example from the first day onwards in pre-season where so many of PLAYER’s teammates who PLAYER usually plays with, so the international players, were not there and to still be able to work that hard, PLAYER did, and train so hard: yeah, and then we all saw the quality in the training sessions. So it's not a surprising thing for me that PLAYER has done so well until now.
PLAYER was already out before we played TEAM and TEAM, PLAYER was out before we played TEAM and PLAYER didn't play TEAM as well and we kept a clean sheet two times against the best teams that have dominated Europe for so long. To go away to TEAM is such a difficult game to play and they have so much quality, throughout the whole squad but especially up front as well. So that they are able to score a goal, that's not a surprise for me."
6,94,26/12/2024,26/12/2024,10,"You always have to do a lot, especially in the league. And that was also [the case] today, because we went 1-0 down. The league table is something of course we are aware of, but we also understand how many games there are still to play.
I think that was crucial today. I was happy with the first-half performance, I was happy with the start. There was only one minute I wasn’t happy with and that was the minute we conceded a goal, that was I think the only thing we didn’t do well during the first half. We created from the start our chances, we threatened them a lot, brought a lot of balls into the box where we arrived with many players – I saw PLAYER many times in front of goal. So, I could not have asked for that much more. But I think it was crucial to score the 1-1 just before half-time because that lifted us up and you could see that immediately in the second half, where we just kept on going with what we did. It was not only helpful for us, but I think it also worked the opposite way for TEAM, they felt like, ‘OK, now it’s going to be tough.’
Yeah, great goal again. Similar to the first one from PLAYER. Like I said, we arrived there many times and if these players – like PLAYER, like PLAYER, like PLAYER, like PLAYER, like PLAYER – if they arrive often enough in promising positions, they will deliver.
I think the main difference maybe is that the set-up of the front three was a bit different [in the past] than the set-up now. We expect a bit from our wingers to keep it wide, to try to get them in one-v-one situations. PLAYER has done this really well. PLAYER has done this really well when PLAYER played from the left but PLAYER is, in our opinion, also capable of playing as a nine; PLAYER did that really well against TEAM. Against TEAM it was mainly maybe PLAYER and PLAYER that were dominant, now it was PLAYER again, together with PLAYER. It’s just nice to have so many options, in every position actually but also in the front three.
I think if you’re in this game for a long time, like these players are and I am as well, then you know 20 games before the end you don’t look at it. You know so many challenges are still ahead of you. I think it was two months ago we were one point behind TEAM and look what has happened there; in terms of injuries and then you have a bit of bad luck, you have a suspension. This can happen to any team, so it’s far too early to already be celebrating.
But it is of course nice for us to be the team who we are. So, we know we are able to do this. But you have been at all these games like me and I don’t think there was any easy win for us during all these games. That tells you how difficult it is to win if all your players are available, let alone if somewhere during the season you pick up some injuries or suspensions. That’s why we just have to take it one game at a time."""
46,84,25/11/2024,25/11/2024,9,"Playing well early for us in the first half was positive.
Behind the scenes, we’ve been trying to hold on to stuff a little bit better, so asking the players to hold on and make sure we didn’t concede towards the end of the game was key.
We’ve been working really hard in-house on that, and I thought the players did it well today.
I’m so delighted for both, PLAYER has been itching to score in training, so it was really positive now take that next step.
PLAYER — PLAYER’s such a bright talent, PLAYER was causing the back line problems with PLAYER’s dribbling and 1v1s.
It’s so positive for us. After the unfortunate ending against TEAM, it was important to turn things around and get back."
49,52,15/12/2024,15/12/2024,9,"We could have got more out of the game today.
But I’ve never seen this team defend or play like that against a world-class side.
Some teams have been here for 10 years, and we’ve been here for 10 games. The tide has got to turn in our favour.
We’ve got to look at ourselves in those moments, not to be quite as naïve.
We’ve got enough experience now to manage those situations better. But I am so proud of the whole squad today. The players were absolutely phenomenal.
That level of defending has got to be our minimum standard.
At half-time, it was just us in our moment, and they came out ready to attack the second half.
They really took the game to them, and the last moments were very shaky for TEAM.
It shows how far we’ve come to hold a team like that.
We’re narrowing the gap every week, and if we keep playing with this grit and resilience, the points will come."
57,99,27/10/2024,27/10/2024,3,"I’m very proud of the team especially with the situation that we are going through at the moment, and probably cannot imagine. But overall I think, especially first half, it was a total domination, we were really, really good, really sharp, really efficient, really determined. And the fact we couldn’t see the game off, especially looking at ourselves, the two things that we didn’t do particular well and obviously about other aspects.
I prefer not to comment.
I don’t know, it’s what it is, we had five injuries in the backline, we have to adapt to it, we’ll continue to adapt, it’s a situation that we have, support them, praise the players because the courage they played today was unbelievable and keep going. 
Yeah really disappointed today, I think we were better but especially because in two things that we had to do a lot better we didn’t and some other stuff obviously.
It’s PLAYER’s consistency and the fact that PLAYER’s very young as well and been very lucky with injuries so hopefully PLAYER continues to be there, but after a few weeks off, the way PLAYER played and competed was exceptional. I think we had some big, big individual performances in the team.
We’ve done everything that we possibly could to accelerate that process, and PLAYER was so willing, the team, the medical staff have done amazing work and we gave ourselves the chance to compete. I don’t know the extent of the injury if there is one, the same with PLAYER.
I don’t know but PLAYER could not run, that’s what PLAYER said straight away, so I don’t know what happened. I don’t know if it's the knee joint or the ankle, they are assessing PLAYER right now.
Prefer not to comment.
No, this is football, circumstances are going to make us better and they are making us better. So if we were able to be where we are and competing the manner that we do, I see the team I have no doubts, three days before I told you we are going to be flying on Sunday, and we started flying and were the better team by far. But we needed to grab the points today to make a reflection of where we are and where we want to be, we couldn’t do it but for sure we are there.
I’m more disappointed and frustrated about one thing that we didn’t do, that we had to do in the second half. The physical part we’ll look at all the stats, the stats I know are dropping, we had better stats in the second half in many games especially individually. Some positives like PLAYER for example hasn’t played 90 minutes for five months, or whatever, so a lot of positive things to take and keep on going.
No, nothing. I’m sure we’ll have some clarity or a letter [about the disallowed goal] afterwards, I don’t know.
I keep that for myself."
