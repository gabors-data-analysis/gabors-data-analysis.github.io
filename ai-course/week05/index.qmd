## Practical Activity

### Manual vs AI Sentiment Analysis Activity

- **Objective:** Practice manually rating football manager statements as positive or negative.
- **Steps:**
  1. Review general sentiment rating scale provided [HERE](/week05/assets/sentiment-scale.md)
  2. Individually analyze and rate **5 provided test statements** from `student_test.csv`.
  3. Now use AI to rate them.
  4. Try have a better domain lexicon. 
 
Discuss experience, how AI helps, what could go wrong. 

### Prediction of score

* Modeling choices of results
* Think about *how* you would do it first
* Check how AI thinks about, rate the examples and look at explanations
* take the 5 examples, and compare your predictions vs the AI predictions  

### Discussion: Validation and Sentiment Analysis

- **Objective:** Discuss validation techniques used in sentiment analysis.
- **Topics for discussion:**
  - Differences between manual and AI ratings
  - Ground Truth
  - Introduction to validation methods:
  - If ground truth -- can do confusion maztric, calculate accuracy
  - If no ground truth -- measure **agreement** between humans and AI. test difference.
    - AI is average, but... 
    - AI with persona?
    - AI biased ?   
    
## End of Week Discussion points

* How precise is AI in sentiment analysis?
* How did *you* compare to AI in terms of scores? How did any difference make you feel? 
* Can you think of a past project where AI could have helped you upgrade it?
